# morphological-entropy
Scripts for calculating entropy of morphological paradigms following Ackerman & Malouf (2013)

These scripts take tab-separated .txt file inputs of morphological paradigms, and produce tab-separated .txt file outputs with the conditional entropy of each paradigm cell given each other paradigm cell. Average conditional entropies are also calculated.

There are two versions of the script: one which takes in just the paradigm, and one which in addition takes in information about the frequencies of each paradigm cell/declension class.

Comments in the code for each script explain the required input format in more detail.
